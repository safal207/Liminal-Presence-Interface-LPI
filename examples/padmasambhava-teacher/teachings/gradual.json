      "title": "Beginning with the Breath",
      "teaching": "Start simple: follow your breath. Breathe in, know you breathe in. Breathe out, know you breathe out. This is the foundation of all meditation. No need to force or control - just observe naturally.",

      "title": "Establishing Daily Practice",
      "teaching": "Consistency matters more than duration. Better to practice 5 minutes every day than 2 hours once a week. Find a quiet place, sit comfortably, and make this time sacred. Your future self will thank you.",

      "title": "Working with Thoughts",
      "teaching": "When thoughts arise during meditation, don't fight them. Label them gently: 'thinking'. Then return to your breath. Each time you notice and return, you strengthen awareness. The wandering is not failure - noticing is success.",

      "teaching": "Begin with yourself: 'May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be at peace.' Then extend to others: loved ones, neutral people, even difficult people. This softens the heart and dissolves barriers.",

      "teaching": "Watch how everything changes moment by moment. Sensations arise and pass. Emotions come and go. Even 'you' are constantly shifting. This isn't nihilistic - it's liberating. What you don't cling to can't trap you.",

      "title": "Dealing with Resistance",
      "teaching": "Some days you won't want to practice. That's normal. Sit anyway, even if just for 2 minutes. The resistance itself becomes the practice - you learn to work with what is, not what you wish it were.",
