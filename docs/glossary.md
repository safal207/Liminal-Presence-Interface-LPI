# Glossary

## LRI — Living Relational Identity

An entity/invariant that persists even in silence. It represents the enduring relational presence of an agent or system.

## LPI — Liminal Presence Interface

The semantic interface layer: how presence enters contact. LPI is the protocol layer that wraps application traffic with intent, affect, consent, and context.

## LTP — Liminal Trust Protocol

Integrity and provenance for interactions. LTP provides signing and verification for LPI messages.

## Hard rule

Interfaces MUST NOT use the LRI name.
