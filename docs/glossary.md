# Glossary

## LRI — Living Relational Identity

- **Entity / invariant**
- Persists across time and non-action
- **Not** an interface or protocol

Represents the enduring relational presence of an agent or system.

## LPI — Liminal Presence Interface

- **Interface layer**
- How presence enters interaction
- Tooling, CLI, and SDKs belong here

LPI is the protocol layer that wraps application traffic with intent, affect, consent, and context.

## LTP — Liminal Trust Protocol

Integrity and provenance for interactions. LTP provides signing and verification for LPI messages.

## Hard rule

Interfaces MUST NOT use the LRI name.
